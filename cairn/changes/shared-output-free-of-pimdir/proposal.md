# Keep pimdir details out of the shared outputs

## Why

The shared commands are a protocol-agnostic API, and pimdir is one backend among several. `card create`, `card update` and `card delete` had gained a `notes` array, and some shared docs named the pimdir store, both describing one backend rather than the operation.

## What

The shared write outputs drop `notes`; the pimdir backend logs a capability its source supports only in part as a warning. The shared docs stop naming pimdir.
