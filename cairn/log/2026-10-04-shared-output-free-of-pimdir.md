# Shared outputs drop the pimdir notes

`card create`, `card update` and `card delete` no longer end with notes or carry a `notes` array, a field pimdir alone filled. The pimdir backend logs a capability its source supports only in part as a warning. The shared docs no longer name pimdir.

Capabilities moved: **backends** (shared outputs carry no backend details).
