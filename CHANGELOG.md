## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added three remote backends alongside CardDAV: JMAP contacts, Microsoft Graph and Google People, each behind its own cargo feature (`jmap`, `msgraph`, `people`).

  None of the three exposes a vCard, so cardamum synthesizes the document of record and re-projects it on write. JMAP converts through JSContact; Graph and People project field by field and stash server-side the properties that have no slot, so nothing is lost round-trip.

- Added the `pimdir` backend: cardamum over a local [pimdir](https://github.com/pimalaya/pimdir) store, the offline cache a sync engine fills.

  A card the sync listed but has not downloaded still lists, and reading it reports "body not fetched" rather than failing. Writes are staged for the next sync to push, and addressbooks come from the sync, so the collection verbs refuse here.

- Added one protocol-specific command family per backend: `carddav`, `jmap`, `msgraph`, `people` and `vdir item`.

  Each mirrors its protocol's own vocabulary and exposes what the shared API hides: ETags and preconditions, sync tokens, `changes` and `delta` incremental sync, multiget, discovery, and the raw native payloads under `--json`. Each also carries an escape hatch for a request the commands do not model, `carddav report raw`, `jmap request`, and `request <METHOD> <PATH>` on Graph and People.

- Added the `configure` command (alias `wizard`), the `-b/--backend` flag selecting between the backends an account declares, and the `account list` and `account check` reports.

### Changed

- Reworked the first run around automatic discovery, aligning it with Himalaya, Ortie, Comodoro and Carillon. **Behaviour change.**

  One prompt takes an email address, a server URL or a local folder path, and its shape orients the setup. Discovery runs in parallel under an 8-second deadline and offers one entry per reachable service, picking one prompting only how to authenticate. The wizard tests the account, then writes it into the configuration file, appending an `[accounts.<name>]` block when one is already there. It configures only what it can discover, and points at config.sample.toml otherwise.

  A missing configuration raises an offer rather than a gate, so the command carries on either way. A bare `cardamum` shows the help when a configuration exists, and nothing prompts when stdin is not a terminal or `--json` is set.

- Renamed the remote backend from `webdav` to `carddav` across the public surface: the cargo feature, the subcommand and the config block. **Breaking.**
- Renamed the shared commands to the singular `addressbook` and `card`, the plural forms staying as hidden aliases. **Breaking.**
- Replaced the positional addressbook id with a `-k/--addressbook` flag across the shared API, falling back to `addressbook.default` everywhere except `addressbook delete`, which stays explicit. **Breaking.**
- Changed `card create` and `card update` to take their vCard as a trailing positional argument, a path, raw contents, or `-` for stdin, instead of the `--file` flag. **Breaking.**
- Relicensed from AGPL-3.0-only to dual MIT OR Apache-2.0.
- Replaced the io-addressbook aggregator with a product-owned cross-backend layer, and upgraded the whole Pimalaya dependency stack.
- Bumped comfy-table to v8. The `table.preset` option keeps accepting the v7 spelling, and truncated cells now end with `…` rather than `...`.
- Replaced the docs/ folder with cairn/, following the Cairn convention.

### Removed

- Removed `account configure` and its `edit` alias: the wizard is the single way to generate an account, and `account list` and `account check` cover inspection. **Breaking.**

### Fixed

- Fixed a 404 against a CardDAV server whose discovery hands back a bare origin rather than the context root, as Fastmail does by serving contacts under `/dav/`. The client now probes `.well-known/carddav` and follows its redirect before the principal walk.
- Fixed the shared commands inventing collections and cards on the vdir backend: `card update` on an unknown id created the file, `card create` on an unknown addressbook created the collection, and an unknown addressbook listed as an empty table. Each fails by name now.
- Fixed `card update` creating a card on CardDAV when the given id does not exist, a WebDAV `PUT` being create-or-replace. The update now reads the card first and guards the write with its ETag; passing your own `--if-match` skips that read.
- Fixed `addressbook update` reporting success when the server changed nothing, and `--description ""` / `--color ""` doing nothing although the help documents `""` as the way to clear a property.
- Fixed the Nix package shipping no manual pages and no shell completions, its install step passing the output directory where a command name was expected.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

- Added the CardDAV backend, over an I/O-free client with rustls and native-tls support.
- Added the vdir backend, one directory per addressbook.
- Added the `addressbooks` and `cards` command families, each with `list`, `read`, `create`, `update` and `delete`.
- Added the multi-account TOML configuration, its secrets read from a shell command or a raw value.
